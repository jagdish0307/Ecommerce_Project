# BuyGenie: Your Smart AI-Powered Laptop Shopping Assistant

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Buying a laptop online can be overwhelming. With hundreds of options and technical specifications—RAM, GPU, processor, screen size, and more—users often struggle to identify which product truly suits their needs. Conventional e-commerce platforms rely heavily on filters and manual searching, which do not always align with what users *actually* mean or want.

## 🎯 Solution: BuyGenie

**BuyGenie** is an AI-powered e-commerce assistant built using LLMs (Large Language Models) to make laptop shopping intuitive, fast, and personalized. Whether you're a gamer, student, or professional, BuyGenie understands your intent and recommends the best options by deeply analyzing your query, product specs, and even your past behavior.

## 🚀 Features

* 🔍 **Smart Search Understanding**: Interprets natural language queries like "I want a lightweight laptop for travel" or "Best gaming laptop under 70k" using LLMs.
* 🧠 **LLM-Powered Query Handler**: Maps user queries to technical attributes like weight, GPU, battery life, RAM, etc.
* 📦 **Semantic Product Retrieval**: Embeds product data and performs semantic search using FAISS to retrieve the most relevant items.
* 👤 **Personalized Recommendations**: Learns from user interaction history stored in SQLite and enhances future results.
* 🤖 **Agent Assistant**: Uses a follow-up agent to answer further questions about products, such as "Does this have a backlit keyboard?" or "Which one has the best display?"

## 🧠 LLM Workflow

1. **Query Understanding (via `llm_query_handler.py`)**:

   * Uses `gemma-2-9b-it` to extract filters like brand, RAM, GPU, use-case, budget, etc.

2. **Semantic Search (via `search_handler.py`)**:

   * Embeds product specs and performs semantic similarity search with FAISS.

3. **Follow-Up Agent (via `agent_handler.py`)**:

   * Uses `llama-4-scout-17b` to answer detailed user queries post-retrieval.
